# SEEED T1000E Ringtones

The [SEEED T1000E](https://muzi.works/products/seeed-t1000e) is a high-performance tracker designed for Meshtastic, as small as a credit card, effortlessly fitting in your pocket or attaching to your assets. It embeds Semtech's LR1110 (Supports 863-928 MHz range), Nordic's nRF52840, and Mediatek's AG3335 GPS module, providing Meshtastic users with a high-precision, low-power positioning and communication solution.

## A Little Background on RTTTL

The T1000E has a user-configurable ringtone that uses [Ring Tone Text Transfer Language (RTTTL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_Tone_Text_Transfer_Language). The default ringtone looks like this:

`24:d=32,o=5,b=565:f6,p,f6,4p,p,f6,p,f6,2p,p,b6,p,b6,p,b6,p,b6,p,b,p,b,p,b,p,b,p,b,p,b,p,b,p,b,1p.,2p.,p`

That ringtone has 2 parts; a header and notes. The header looks like this:
- `24` - Name/identifier for the ringtone
- `d=32` - Default note duration (32nd note)
- `o=5` - Default octave (5th octave)
- `b=565` - Beats per minute (tempo = 565 BPM, which is quite fast)

After the header, you have a list of notes to play. Notes are comma-separated and include 4 parameters:
- duration
- pitch
- octave
- dotted-duration

## Meshtastic Notification Config
Be sure to set the `Nag Timeout` to a lower number, otherwise it'll pester you over and over again until you press the button on the T1000E. If you set it to `0`, it will only play the notification once.

## Nokia Composer
Here's a good website that allows you to play with RTTTL strings and have them playback for you in the browser. Plus it has some fun examples baked into the page.
